James Lippmann â€“ Data & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data engineering and analytics projects!

I'm James, a Data Engineer with a background in leading creative projects and a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. My tech journey began by analysing streaming and audience data within the music industry, which inspired me to advance my skills through a data engineering bootcamp at Northcoders. There, I gained practical experience with Python, SQL, AWS, and cloud platforms.

Experienced in Jira and Agile methodologies, I tackle complex challenges with a structured, collaborative mindset. Iâ€™m eager to bring together my creative and technical expertise in a data-focused role. Additionally, I hold PRINCE2 Foundation and ACCA Diploma certifications, underpinning my commercially aware and process-driven approach to delivering projects.
